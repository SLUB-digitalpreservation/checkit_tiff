# chromaticity of the alignment white of a monitor, the filter set and light source combination of a
# scanner or the imaging model of a rendering package. The ordering is white[x], white[y].  
# (Source: www.awaresystems.be)
# example: CIE Standard Illuminant D65 used by CCIR Recommendation 709 and Kodak PhotoYCC is:
# 3127/10000,3290/10000

# PrimaryChromaticities, This is the chromaticity for each of the primaries when it has its ReferenceWhite
# value and the other primaries have their ReferenceBlack values. These values are described using the

# to the chromaticities of the phosphors of a monitor, the filter set and light source combination of a 
# scanner or the imaging model of a rendering package. 
# (Source: www.awaresystems.be)
# The ordering is red[x], red[y], green[x], green[y], blue[x], and blue[y].
