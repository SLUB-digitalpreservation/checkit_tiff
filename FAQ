Q: "make" reports "usage: git rev-list [OPTION] â€¦"
A: the Makefile uses version.mk to build a version information for the tool.
   In that case you should comment out the lines in version.mk and set
   REPO_REVISION manually

Q: I did not have "peg" and my config_dsl.grammar.c has zero size and there are
   compile errors.
A: remove that file and use "git checkout config_dsl.grammar.c" to restore it
   from repository. Try to avoid "make distclean", because it erases the file.

Q: My C-compiler reports error-messages like "cc: error: unrecognized command
   line option '-fsanitize=undefined'"
A: You use an older GCC variant. Try 'SANITIZE="" make'

Q: How can I compile a windows version of your program?
A: I have only tested creating Windows executables using the crosscompiler
   minGW under Debian Jessie. You need the installed mingw-w64-x86-32 packages,
   also you need to download and extract libpcre. in
   libpcre (pcre-8.37), call "./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32
   --disable-win32-io --disable-shared -enable-static" and "make -j 4". Change
   into checkit-tiff/build, call: 
   "cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain-mingw32.cmake ../src/ 
   -DPCRE_LIBRARY=~/Downloads/pcre-8.37/.libs/libpcre.a 
   -DPCRE_INCLUDE_DIR=~/Downloads/pcre-8.37/ ../src/" and "make -j 4"

Q: How to compile to Javascript?
A: Use emscripten, do same steps as above but with "emconfigure
   ./configure...". Compile checkit_tiff with ff. options:
   $> emcmake cmake
   -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which emcc)
   -DPCRE_LIBRARY=~/Downloads/pcre-8.37/.libs/libpcre.a
   -DPCRE_INCLUDE_DIR=~/Downloads/pcre-8.37/ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-Oz -s
   TOTAL_MEMORY=400000000" ../src/"
   $> make -j 4
   $> js checkit_tiff.js -c ../tiffs_should_pass/minimal_valid.tiff ../example_configs/cit_tiff6_baseline_SLUB.cfg

Q: Where are older TIFF specs?
A: take a look to:
  TIFF 4: https://web.archive.org/web/20050323073243/http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff4.html
  TIFF 5: https://web.archive.org/web/20050323073243/http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/bytopic/imaging/std/tiff5.html

Q: I am using cmake, but it fails with "CMake Error: your CXX compiler:
   "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found.   Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
   to a valid compiler path or name". But your program is C only, why I need a
   C++compiler then?
A: cmake uses C++-compiler for its checks. Sorry, you need a C++ then.

Q: Your tool processes very slow, why?
A: No, the tool is optimized for very fast processing. On a NVME-based SSD it
   processes 550 TIFF files (2,9GB) in less 3 seconds. We have tested it also
   on our NFS based filesystem with similar fast results.  There is only one
   cornercase, if you have a broken TIFF with very large IFDs. Because
   checkit_tiff tries to find all errors in a given TIFF file it does not use
   early aborts than some other tools.

Q: I have a fully destroyed TIFF because checkit_tiff reports IFD errors. Is
   there any chance to repair the file?
A: You could give "fixit_tiff" a try:
   https://github.com/SLUB-digitalpreservation/fixit_tiff
   This project comes with some helper tools to find lost IFDs and could
   fix some typical errors in broken TIFF files.
