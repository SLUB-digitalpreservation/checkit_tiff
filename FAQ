Q: I got "fatal error: tiff.h: No such file or directory"
A: You need an installed libtiff (Debian Jessie: libtiff5-dev)

Q: "make" reports "usage: git rev-list [OPTION] â€¦"
A: the Makefile uses version.mk to build a version information for the tool.
   In that case you should comment out the lines in version.mk and set
   REPO_REVISION manually

Q: I did not have "peg" and my config_dsl.grammar.c has zero size and there are
   compile errors.
A: remove that file and use "git checkout config_dsl.grammar.c" to restore it
   from repository. Try to avoid "make distclean", because it erases the file.

Q: My C-compiler reports error-messages like "cc: error: unrecognized command
   line option '-fsanitze=undefined'"
A: You use an older GCC variant. Try 'SANITIZE="" make'

Q: The compiler reports, that the function TIFFFiledName does not exists. What
   is the reason?
A: You use an older version of the libtiff. If you cannot update, try this:
'CFLAGS="-DOLDTIFF" make', this enables an alternative in check_helper.c

Q: How can I compile a windows version of your program?
A: I have only tested creating Windows executables using the crosscompiler
   minGW under Debian Jessie, please see the instructions in 
   the ../README.windows file.

Q: I tried to compile with 'SANITIZE="-DOLDTIFF" make' under Debian Wheezy,
   but I got the message "error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before
   'uint64'", why?
A: You are using the Debian-package libtiff4-dev, but at least libtiff5-dev is
   expected. The reason for the error was that the uint64 type is only defined
   in newer tiff.h files.

Q: Where are older TIFF specs?
A: take a look to:
